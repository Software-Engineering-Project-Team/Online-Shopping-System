## Overview

The Online Shopping Project is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate seamless online shopping experiences while providing robust administrative control. The site is database-driven, supporting any DBMS of choice. The front-end allows users to create and modify their information, register for accounts, and manage their shopping cart, which includes displaying items, calculating taxes at an 8.25% rate, applying discount codes, and providing a summary for order placement. Users can also search for items based on various criteria such as item description, price, and availability. The back-end offers an administrative interface where administrators can modify all items, create discount codes and sales items, manage users, and view orders both current and historical, with sorting options by order date, customer, and order size. Additionally, administrators can create and modify items for sale, including adding images, prices, and quantities.
